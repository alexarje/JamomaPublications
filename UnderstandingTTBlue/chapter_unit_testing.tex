\chapter{Unit Testing}

Note: This chapter currently serves as the specification for the unit testing facilities in TTBlue.  The unit testing facilities are only partially (if at all) implemented.  Thus, this chapter is detailing how it should work in the future, and not necessarily how it works right now.
