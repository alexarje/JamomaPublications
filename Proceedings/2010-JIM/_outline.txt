Key words (to define)

- platform
- art-based research

TOC draft

1 Jamoma philosophy, aims, goals

1.1 general stuff

1.1.1 background

5 years old project, Tim

1.1.2 team
1.1.3 (institution) support
 
1.2 Art-based / art-oriented research
1.2.1 definition

J. as tool for creation
J. as prototype plateform

underline bidirectional relationship : tools offered to artists ALSO tools modeled based on artists feedback, needs, etc.

1.2.2 community, collaborations

Virage, gesture analysis researches, etc.

//** or maybe 1. definition and bidirectional relationship, 2. art projects, 3. research **//


2. Past, present and coming developments
2.1 background: Max based project
2.1.1 Modular 0.5

update Max 5, new additions, documentation

although Modular remains (probably for most users?) the most visible part, lot of dev happened

2.2 architecture
2.2.1 mini timeline or something

pure Max -> externals -> framework //** Is that correct ? **//

2.2.2 Jamoma current architecture

3. How this expands Jamoma possibilities for future
3.1 "reversed organisation of Jamoma"

I mean, to schematize how I see/understand it, Modular is now more an exmaple of what is possible with Jamoma rather than the origin of developments, if that makes sense.

3.2 multiplateforme

3.2.1 for Max, AudioUnit, PD, etc.
3.2.2 "interoperability"

example export of audio graph ?

3.?.?...

Conclusion
------------------


Focus

- Background
- philosophy, aims, goals ?

- supports and related projects

- projects
-- pedagogical uses
-- research platform

How this can be expanded in the future ?

- Past & coming architecture changes
- "openness"
