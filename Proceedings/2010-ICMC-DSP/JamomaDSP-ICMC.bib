	Abstract = {One of the important challenges facing music information retrieval (MIR) of audio signals is scaling analysis algo- rithms to large collections. Typically, analysis of audio signals utilizes sophisticated signal processing and ma- chine learning techniques that require significant compu- tational resources. Therefore, audio MIR is an area were computational resources are a significant bottleneck. For example, the number of pieces utilized in the majority of existing work in audio MIR is at most a few thousand files. Computing audio features over thousands files can some- times take days of processing. In this paper, we describe how Marsyas-0.2, a free software framework for audio analysis and synthesis can be used to rapidly implement efficient distributed audio analysis algorithms. The frame- work is based on a dataflow architecture which facilitates partitioning of audio computations over multiple comput- ers. Experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach are presented.},

	Abstract = {Marsyas is a software framework for building efficient complex audio processing systems and applications. Al- though originally designed for Music Information Retrieval (MIR) tasks in the past few years it has been expanded to include any type of audio analysis or synthesis. Com- plex Audio processing systems are defined hierarchically through composition using implicit patching. Both the specification of the processing network and the control of it while data is flowing through can be performed at runtime without requiring recompilation. Compilation is required only when new processing objects need to be de- fined. Therefore the Marsyas runtime provides consider- able functionality and flexibility. In this paper we demon- strate how the Marsyas runtime can be accessed using a variety of different ways allowing non-trivial interactions with common software frameworks and environments.},

@inproceedings{Bray:2005,
	Abstract = {Programming software for audio analysis and synthesis is challenging. Dataflow-based approaches provide a declar- ative specification of computation and result in efficient code. Most practitioners of computer music are familiar with some form of dataflow programming where audio applications are constructed by connecting components with ``wires'' that carry data. Examples include networks of unit generators in Music-V style languages and visual patches in Max/Msp or PD. Even though existing dataflow- based audio systems offer a concise conceptual model of signal computation, this model does have limitations. In many cases, these limitations are a consequence of the programmer having to explicitly specify connections be- tween components. Two such limitations are the diffi- culty of handling spectral data and the need for fixed-size buffers between components. In this paper we introduce Implicit Patching (IP), a dataflow-based approach to audio analysis and synthesis that attempts to address these limi- tations. By extending dataflow semantics a large number of connections are automatically created and buffer sizes can be changed dynamically. We describe Marsyas-0.2, a software framework based on IP, and comment on the strengths and limitations of the proposed approach.},

@phdthesis{wang:2008,
	Abstract = {The computer has long been considered an extremely attractive tool for creating, manipulating, and analyzing sound. Its precision, possibilities for new timbres, and potential for fantastical automation make it a compelling platform for expression and experimentation - but only to the extent that we are able to express to the computer what to do, and how to do it. To this end, the programming language has perhaps served as the most general, and yet most precise and intimate interface between humans and computers. Furthermore, ``domain-specific'' languages can bring additional expressiveness, conciseness, and perhaps even different ways of thinking to their users.This thesis argues for the philosophy, design, and development of ChucK, a general-purpose programming language tailored for computer music. The goal is to create a language that is expressive and easy to write and read with respect to time and parallelism, and to provide a platform for precise audio synthesis/analysis and rapid experimentation in computer music. In particular, ChucK provides a syntax for representing information flow, a new time-based concurrent programming model that allows programmers to flexibly and precisely control the flow of time in code (we call this ``strongly-timed''), and facilities to develop programs on-the-fly - as they run. A ChucKian approach to live coding as a new musical performance paradigm is also described. In turn, this motivates the Audicle, a specialized graphical environ- ment designed to facilitate on-the-fly programming, to visualize and monitor ChucK programs in real-time, and to provide a platform for building highly customizable user interfaces.In addition to presenting the ChucK programming language, a history of music and programming is provided (Chapter 2), and the various aspects of the ChucK language are evaluated in the context of computer music research, performance, and pedagogy (Chapter 6). As part of an extensive case study, the thesis discusses ChucK as a primary teaching and development tool in the Princeton Laptop Or- chestra (PLOrk), which continues to be a powerful platform for deploying ChucK 1) to teach topics ranging from programming to sound synthesis to music com- position, and 2) for crafting new instruments, compositions, and performances for computer-mediated ensembles. Additional applications are also described, includ- ing classrooms, live coding arenas, compositions and performances, user studies, and integrations of ChucK into other software systems.The contributions of this work include the following. 1) A time-based pro- gramming mechanism (both language and underlying implementation) for ultra- precise audio synthesis, naturally extensible to real-time audio analysis. 2) A non- preemptive, time/event-based concurrent programming model that provides fun- damental flexibility and readability without incurring many of the difficulties of programming concurrency. 3) A ChucKian approach to writing code and design- ing audio programs on-the-fly. This rapid prototyping mentality has potentially wide ramifications in the way we think about coding audio, in designing/testing software (particular for real-time audio), as well as new paradigms and practices in computer-mediated live performance. 4) The Audicle as a new type of audio programming environment that combines live development with visualizations. 5) Extended case studies of using, teaching, composing, and performing with ChucK, most prominently in the Laptop Orchestra. These show the power of teaching pro- gramming via music, and vice versa - and how these two disciplines can reinforce each other.},

ViMiC (Virtual Microphone Control) is a tool for real-time spatialization synthesis, particularly for concert situations and site-specific im- mersive installations, and especially for larger or non- centralized audiences. Based on the concept of virtual microphones positioned within a virtual 3D room, ViMiC supports loudspeaker reproduction up to 24 discrete chan- nels for which the loudspeakers do not necessarily have to be placed uniformly and equidistant around the audience. Also, through the integrated Open Sound Control protocol (OSC), ViMiC is easily accessed and manipulated.},

	Annote = {The NeXT computer provides a powerful system for creating and manipulating sound and music. The software for this system is divided into two object-orientedclass librariesknown as kits. The Sound Kit provides object-oriented access to the basic sound capabilities of the NeXT computer, allowing sound recording,playback,display,and editing. The Music Kit provides classes for compos- ing, storing,performing,andsynthesizing music. It lets you communicate with external synthesizers or create your own software instruments. Both kits areimplemented in the Objective-Cobject-oriented programminglanguage. Although they are largely independent of each other, they can also be used to a unified end. The Sound Kit, for instance, can record sound data that can be used in a Music Kit performance.

This papergives an overview of the NeXT sound and music software. A brief description of the NeXT sound hardwareis also included.

	Abstract = {The NeXT Music Kit is a programmer's library of objects for DSP sound synthesis, MIDI processing, and music manipulations. Although oriented around the needs of music, its functionality is quite general and includes paradigms such as message sequencing and real- time signal processing. Previous ICMC papers described aspects of the Music Kit's structure and implementation. In this paper, the Music Kit is viewed from the standpoint of its use in a variety of domains, including algorithmic composition, real-time interactive DSP and MIDI performance, sound manipulation, DSP orchestration, psycho-acoustic research, teaching, multi-media data visualization, animation, and games. The live presentation of this paper focuses on demonstrations of Music Kit-based applications, while the written text looks in detail at the Music Kit mechanisms behind the scenes.},
