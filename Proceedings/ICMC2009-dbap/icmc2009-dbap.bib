@article{Litovsky:1999precedence_effect,
	Abstract = {In a reverberant environment, sounds reach the ears through several paths. Although the direct sound is followed by multiple reflections, which would be audible in isolation, the first-arriving wavefront dominates many aspects of perception. The "precedence effect" refers to a group of phenomena that are thought to be involved in resolving competition for perception and localization between a direct sound and a reflection. This article is divided into five major sections. First, it begins with a review of recent work on psychoacoustics, which divides the phenomena into measurements of fusion, localization dominance, and discrimination suppression. Second, buildup of precedence and breakdown of precedence are discussed. Third measurements in several animal species, developmental changes in humans, and animal studies are described. Fourth, recent physiological measurements that might be helpful in providing a fuller understanding of precedence effects are reviewed. Fifth, a number of psychophysical models are described which illustrate fundamentally different approaches and have distinct advantages and disadvantages. The purpose of this review is to provide a framework within which to describe the effects of precedence and to help in the integration of data from both psychophysical and physiological experiments. It is probably only through the combined efforts of these fields that a full theory of precedence will evolve and useful models will be developed.},

	Annote = {State-of-the-art systems for the reproduction of spatial audio suffer from a serious problem: The spatial properties of the reproduced sound can only be perceived correctly in a small part of the listening area, the so-called sweet spot. This restriction occurs because conventional reproduction of spatial audio is based on psychoacoustics, e.i. mainly intensity panning techniques. A solution to this problem calls for a new reproduction technique which allows the synthesis of physically correct wave fields of three-dimensional acoustic scenes. It should result in a large listening areas which is not restricted to a particular sweet spot.

A number of different apporaches have been suggested. They can be roughly categorized into advanced panning techniques, ambisonics, and wave field synthesis. Advanced panning techniques aim at enlarging the sweet spot well known from two-channel stereo or 5-channel surround sound systems. An example is the vector based amplitude panning technique (VBAP) as described in e.g. [1]. Ambisonicssystems represent the sound field in an enclosure by an expansion into three-dimensional basis-functions A faithful reproduction of this sound field requires techniques for the cintributions of all relevant basis functions. In common realizations, only the lowest order contributions are exploited [2].

This chapter represents the third approach from above, wave field synthesis (WFS). It is a technique for reproducing the acoustics of large recording rooms in smaller sized listening rooms. The spatial properties of the acoustical scene can be perceived correctly by an arbitrary large number of listeners which are allowed to move freely inside the listening area without the need of their positions being tracked. These features are achieved through a strict foundation on the basic laws of acoustical wave propagation.

WFS typically use more loudspeakers than audio channels. Contrary to conventional spatial audio reproduction techniques like two-channel stereo or 5-channel surround, there exists no fixed mapping of the audio channels to the reproduction loudspeakers. Instead, a representation of the three-dimensional acoustic scene is used that can be reproduced by various WFS systems utilizing different loudspeaker setups.

---

The theoretical basis of WFS is given by Huygen's principle. Huygen stated that any point of a propagating wave at any instant conforms to the envelope of spherical waves emanating from every point on the wavefront at the prior instant. This principle can be used to synthesize acoustic wave fronts of arbitrary shape. Of course, it is not very practical to position the acoustic sources on the wave fronts for synthesizers with a loudspeaker array.


Deviations from true sound pressure distribution. To effects are observed:

1) Spatial aliasing

2. truncation effects


aliasing frequency  F_{al} = \frac{c}{ 2 \DELTA \lambda fi_max }

fi_{max} denotes the maximum angle of incidence of the synthesized plane wave relative to the loudspeaker array. 

If \DELTA \lambda = 10 cm, the minimum spatial aliasing frequency is f_{al} = 17000 Hz

Truncation effects appear when the line is represented by a loudspeaker array of finite extension. They can be understood as diffraction waves propagating from the ends of the loudspeaker arrays. Truncation effects can be minimized, e.g. by filtering in the spatial domain (tapering, windowing) [7].



Model-based rendering may be interpreted as a special case of the data-based approach: Instead of measuring room impulses, models for acoustic sources are used to calculate the loudspeaker driving signals. Point sources and plane waves are the most common models used in model-based WFS systems.

@article{Poletti:2000holographic_sound,
	Abstract = {A theoretical foundation is developed for horizontal holographic surroundsound systems 
based on the two-dimensional Fourier transform. It is shown how the theory leads to the 
recording and reproduction of sound fields using circular arrays of microphones and loud- 
speakers. DFI" processing of circular microphone arrays produces the spherical harmonics 
of the sound field, and is a generalization of certain higher order multipole microphones. 
The performance of the array is shown to be improved by using directional microphone 
elements. The angular sine panning functions arise naturally from the reproduction theory, 
and a mode-matching approach further verifies that they are optimum at low frequencies. 
General windowing is reviewed for the control of artifacts at high frequencies and the radial 
error is proposed as a useful parameter for designing windows. Sound intensity theory is 
examined for visualizing surround sound fields, and a complex instantaneous velocity is 
introduced, which is easy to generate and equivalent to previous definitions for the case of 
monochromatic sound fields. The reproduction performance of a five-loudspeaker surround 
system is examined, and its performance over wider reproduction areas is also considered.

	Abstract = {In Ambisonics sound is encoded and stored in multichannel sound files and is decoded for playback. In the en- and decoding process complicated functions are used. In this paper panning functions equivalent to the result of en- and decoding are presented which can be used for real-time panning in an arbitrary high ambisonic order. In the function equivalent to the socalled in-phase decoding the order of ambisonic resolution is just a variable that can be any positive number not restricted to integers and that can be changed during playback. The limitations and advantages of the technique are mentioned, real time applications are described and the computational costs are estimated. The described procedure offers a new intuitive understanding of Ambisonics.

	Abstract = {{The goal of this book is to apply the principles of acoustics to the audio arts. This involves serving as an interpreter of major trends and the literature for students and practitioners in the audio field. Along with covering the more theoretical aspects of acoustics, the book applies the theory to the design of specialized audio spaces such as the home listening room, the control room, and the multi-track-recording studio.}},
