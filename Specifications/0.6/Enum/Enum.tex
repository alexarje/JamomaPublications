\section{Overview}

it has been discussed to add a new parameter type "enum", to store and address enumerated lists (e.g. menus)

This spec is far from complete.


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Use Cases}

\subsection{Case 1: Automatically generated documentation}

Make our ref pages better.


\subsection{Case 2: Mapper modules}

Maybe?  I'm not sure...


\subsection{Case 3: Virage Sequencer Queries}

We discussed this in Montr√©al and it seemed to be the most demanding use case for querying, etc.  I don't remember all of the details and scenarios though [tap].
 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Data Flow}

- items can be addressed through index number or item's name (symbol)
- the list of all available items are stored as /range attributes and can be changed dynamically and queried remotely
- we need a notification system so that jcom.nodeview is informed if the list of items is changed... 



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Open Issues}

maybe we want to return the current item to the world as an index number OR the item's name... how do we manage that ?
